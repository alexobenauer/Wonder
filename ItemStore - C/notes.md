#  Item Store in C

## Upgrades

- itemstore.c: This is only a partial implementation atm. Refer to ItemStore.swift for what else itemstore.c would need for a more complete implementation.
- sldrive.c: Could get some better performance by having a "fetchMostRecentFact(i,a,v)" function; it's a common use.
